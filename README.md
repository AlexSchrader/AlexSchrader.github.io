To clone my repository; I first had to download GitHub desktop, after that I opened GitHub and found the repository I made on GitHub.com and clicked clone, then when selecting where to clone it I selected my CTI-110 folder anded it there. Then I added a summary in order to commit my changes I had made by cloning it to the CTI folder.
